Love, We Must Part Now
by Philip Larkin

Love, we must part now: do not let it be 
Calamitious and bitter. In the past 
There has been too much moonlight and self-pity:
Let us have done with it: for now at last 
Never has sun more boldly paced the sky, 
Never were hearts more eager to be free, 
To kick down worlds, lash forests; you and I 
No longer hold them; we are husks, that see 
The grain going forward to a different use. 

There is regret. Always, there is regret.
But it is better that our lives unloose, 
As two tall ships, wind-mastered, wet with light, 
Break from an estuary with their courses set, 
And waving part, and waving drop from sight.
